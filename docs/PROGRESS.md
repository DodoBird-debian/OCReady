# Implementation record

## Iteration 0 — architecture and delivery contract

- Created the empty repository and a modular plan with more than 1,000 lines.
- Chose native Qt for Arabic shaping, bidirectional editing, accessibility, and clipboard images.
- Chose Tesseract fast/best for offline OCR, plus an isolated llama.cpp adapter for optional vision-language inference.
- Defined decimal memory budgets over the application and its child processes.
- Chose Nuitka onefile distribution for Linux and Windows, with explicitly bundled runtime data.
- Established that model-size estimates do not certify runtime memory or Arabic accuracy.

The plan describes both the implementation sequence and release gates. Pending items are not claims of completed functionality.

## Iteration 1 — real offline OCR core

- Implemented edition manifests, bounded image decoding, immutable preprocessing recipes, logical-order TSV parsing, and source word ranges.
- Added Tesseract fast/best adapters, sequential layout comparison, process-tree RSS sampling, cancellation, timeout, and subprocess cleanup.
- Added a headless CLI with JSON/text output, diagnostics, language selection, preprocessing switches, and explicit error exit codes.
- Prepared a relocatable Linux OCR runtime without administrator access; pinned Arabic/English fast/best assets by upstream commit and SHA256.
- Rendered a real shaped bilingual fixture with Qt; the engine extracted `مرحبا بالعالم`, `اللغة العربية واللغة الإنجليزية`, and the English paragraphs correctly.
- Observed 31 located words and 75.7 MB process-tree peak RSS for the small bilingual headless case. This is not a GUI, large-image, or universal memory certification.
- Validation: 14 core tests including real English/bilingual OCR, cancellation, timeout, bounded transforms, image safety, Unicode offsets, and shell-safe arguments; Ruff lint.
- Found and corrected a real packaging issue: Tesseract's named `tsv` config was absent from the minimal language-data payload. The adapter now enables TSV directly with `tessedit_create_tsv=1`.
- Remaining: native workspace, capture integration, real VLM inference, binary compilation, Windows validation, and broad memory benchmarks.

## Iteration 2 — native copy-and-paste workspace

- Built the styled native Qt application with a resizable image/text split, readable empty states, bilingual example, editing, text export, shortcuts, and live RAM display.
- Added zoom/pan, source-word boxes, click/rectangle selection, source-to-editor and editor-to-source highlighting, and selection-only copying.
- Source linking is invalidated after manual edits or image transformations; outdated recognition job IDs are rejected.
- Added clipboard images, image drag-and-drop, reversible inversion/grayscale/contrast/threshold, rotation, mirroring, cropping, and original/processed views.
- Added asynchronous Spectacle region capture and Windows Snipping Tool clipboard ingestion. Checked Spectacle's installed command-line options; interactive capture and Windows round-trip still require desktop validation.
- Added settings persistence without storing images or OCR text, safe close/cancellation, actionable inline errors, and diagnostics.
- Inspected the native rendered workspace with real bilingual OCR and highlighted Arabic words; screenshot in `docs/images/workspace.png`.
- Observed about 120 MB application RSS after the small GUI sample (OCR completed). This does not certify the worst case or include a concurrent VLM.
- Validation: 21 passing tests including real Arabic source clicks/copying, editor linking, edit invalidation, stale result rejection, native clipboard import, background OCR completion, and reversible cleanup; Ruff passed.
- Remaining: real local VLM and CUDA testing, binary compilation, Windows/KDE interactive validation, large-image memory benchmarks, and platform hard-limit policies.
